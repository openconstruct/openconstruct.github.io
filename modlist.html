<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2874527504">[GMT] TicksPerSecond 1.5</a> by Grizzlemethis</h5>

<p>Add actual ticks per second to the information display above the pause/speed controls.<br />
Update: TPS values are now rounded off.<br />
For example 59.90 will now show as 60.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3228047321">Blood Animations</a> by Fuu Chan</h5>

<p>Extreme violence!<br />
Adds blood sprays, animated bleeding, ricochets, impact debris, and bullet casings!<br />
Directional blood sprays (Videos above)<br />
*Triggered by direct damage, such as bullets, explosions, and damaging psycasts, and the blood amount scales based on the damage done.<br />
*Blood particles last ~10s (configurable in options) and will fade away on it's own.<br />
*20% (configurable in options) of particles will leave filth behind, which requires cleanup like vanilla blood.<br />
Animated bleeding<br />
*Animated bleeding based on pawn bleed rate.<br />
Ricochets<br />
*When bullets are deflected by body armor, or when hitting hard targets like mechanoids, visual ricochet animations may occur!<br />
Impact Debris<br />
*When hitting inorganic pawns or structures, debris will fly out!<br />
*Impact debris follow similar rules to blood spray.<br />
Compatible with Vanilla Expanded Framework blood types (Vanilla Races Expanded, Alpha Genes) as well as HAR (Humanoid Alien Races)<br />
Bullet Casings<br />
*Originally a mod called [Syr] Bullet Casings. It was one of my favorites, but sadly no longer updated. So here it is reimplemented, with improved animations and fixed to be compatible with everything since 1.4 including modded weapons. This feature can be disabled in the options. Credit and thanks to Syrchalis!<br />
Performance<br />
Inevitably, extra objects on the map has a cost, but these objects are relatively simple and do not last a long time, and how much and how long can be configured to the point where it has nearly 0% impact. So in the big scheme of things, the performance cost shouldn't be noticeable and can be configured to match your needs.<br />
Compatibility<br />
*Adjustable performance impact (Blood multiplier, cleanable filth chance, and fade time can be configured to fit your performance needs).<br />
*Safe to add and remove mid-game.<br />
*Independent, isolated, and minimal in scope, with no modifications to vanilla behavior/code required: Should be compatible with nearly every mod, leaves no permanent changes to your saved game, and will not brick your game.<br />
*Confirmed compatible with Combat Extended, Vanilla Expanded series, Alpha series, Dubs series, Ragdoll Physics, Melee Animation, Yayo's Animation, Layered Wall Destruction, Gore upon dismemberment, Gunplay, Blood Color Genes, HAR (Humanoid Alien Races), and hundreds more.<br />
Updates<br />
~1.05 update: Added Bullet Casings feature!<br />
~1.04 update: Particles should now properly despawn based on the time defined in the mod options, rather than the time defined in the XML.<br />
~1.03 update: Fix for System.IndexOutOfRangeException.<br />
~1.02 update: Particles were skidding for longer than intended due to a small forgor.<br />
~1.01 update: Added backwards compatibility for 1.4<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3211635205">Improved Need Indicator</a> by AmCh, Missionz3r0</h5>

<p>A pawn has several needs. If you hover over those needs, you'll see a tooltip.<br />
This tooltip has some helpful text, but it could be better.<br />
Improved Need Indicator adds helpful timers to a need's tooltip so you know<br />
exactly how long you have until that need is unfulfilled.<br />
Implemented:<br />
* Food<br />
* Indoors<br />
* Outdoors<br />
* Recreation<br />
* Rest<br />
On Deck:<br />
* Beauty<br />
Upcoming:<br />
* Chemical<br />
* Comfort<br />
* Deathrest<br />
* Energy<br />
* Kill Satiety<br />
* Learning<br />
* Play<br />
Why?<br />
Because I spent three hours building a spreadsheet to figure out how long my pawns sleep and just knew there had to be a better way. Sleep alone is a complicated formula using the pawn's own 'Rest Rate Multiplier', bed type, bed material, bed quality, and number of sleep accelorators. Did you know making the bed out of marble to get that sweet beauty bonus makes your pawn sleep longer? Or that Jade doesn't count as stone and works the same as wood? Who knew?! I fricken didn't.<br />
Don't fall down the same rabbit hole I did. We've done the work for you here. Install the mod, shower us with praise, and sleep better than ever.<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2918091446">Inject Genes</a> by Zaf</h5>

<p>Allows you to inject a gene without having to make an xenotype first.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1516158345">Interaction Bubbles</a> by Jaxe</h5>

<p>Mod Version: 3.0<br />
Shows bubbles when pawns perform a social interaction with the text that would normally only be found in the log.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3237084161">Justice For Flagstone</a> by Kharshuf</h5>

<p>This mod pushes flagstone more into the "cheap, but worse than stone tiles" category it is supposed to take. Cuts flagstone cost in half, but also slightly lowers the movespeed on it.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800857642">Map Preview</a> by m00nl1ght</h5>

<p>Adds a map preview to the world map.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2011469982">Medieval - Vanilla</a> by SickBoyWI</h5>

<p>This mod removes everything from the game after the Medieval Era. Everything else stays vanilla. <br />
How long can you survive what the storyteller is throwing at you?! There really isn't an end game here, since you can't make a spaceship and fly away. <br />
Notes: <br />
*This will conflict with any other mods that reference vanilla items that are post-medieval. The game will still work, but you'll see errors in the log if you look. You may also see errors related to mods referencing post-medieval stuff.<br />
*This may not work with scenarios that have post-medieval items as a part of the starting items list. You'll see log errors, and the futuristic items won't spawn.<br />
*NOT COMPATIBLE WITH BIOTECH OR ROYALTY. Those DLCs rely on future tech, and this mod removes that stuff from the game.<br />
I made this at the request of several players who were interested, while the other more popular medieval solutions are updated for the latest game version.<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3128454510">Medieval Backstories No HAR</a> by AssassinsBro</h5>

<p>This mod adds over 50 new backstories for medieval pawns. This is a port of Shenanigans' mod to not use the HAR (Humanoid Alien Races) dependency.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023507013">Vanilla Expanded Framework</a> by Oskar Potocki,  XeoNovaDan,  Orion,  Kikohi,  Taranchuk,  Sarg Bjornson,  Erdelf</h5>

<p>Vanilla Expanded Framework incorporates a multitude of functionalities for different mods in order for us to boost performance by not duplicating code across several mods. Examples of shared functionality include custom base generation code with an amazing building export tool, customisable sieges, faction-based pack animal textures, faction based apparel colouring system, Orion’s Faction Discovery revamped and improved, Item processor code, shields, and many, many others.<br />
Orion's Faction Discovery?<br />
Yes!We have negotiated a deal with Orion and included his Faction Discovery mod within Vanilla Expanded Framework. Now, if you decide to add a faction to an existing playthrough, upon loading up the save you will have an option to spawn it's settlements and define how many of them you would like to spawn, as well as how far away from the player.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2016436324">Vanilla Textures Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Helixien,  Erin,  Luizi,  ISOREX,  erdelf,  Sarg</h5>

<p>Vanilla Textures Expanded is a full-scale overhaul of vanilla (unmodded) RimWorld textures, with its main aim being not only to fix less aesthetically pleasing textures, but also to bring vanilla aesthetic in-line with that of Vanilla Expanded mod series.<br />
This texture pack includes over 450 textures remade in vector-based software (same method used for Vanilla Expanded mods), exported into 2x the size of vanilla textures. What used to be blurred before, now will be sharp and crisp, even if zoomed in fully using mods by the likes of Camera+.<br />
When redrawing vanilla textures, our main focus was on keeping them consistent with what players are used to - don’t expect any drastic design changes - we have only changed the look of things that were really bad or ambiguous.<br />
We plan to keep adding new textures in the future, so make sure to let us know what particular textures in vanilla game require changes!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3210544395">[SYR] Processor Framework</a> by Syrchalis</h5>

<p>A framework for processors to transform items and more, read player features!<br />
Main Feature<br />
A processor takes a set of ingredients and turns it autonomously into a product over a period of time. The framework supports a huge variety of settings to individualize the processes and brings easy to use UI for players, as well as several other improvements, like better textures.<br />
Players benefits:<br />
- New HD barrel texture<br />
- Barrel can be made of any wood type<br />
- Brewery can be made of any wood type<br />
- ITab to quickly select products and ingredients<br />
- Products are shown on the processing building<br />
- Performance-improvements over vanilla<br />
- Button in settings to replace vanilla barrels<br />
The mod is mainly aimed at mod authors who want to add any sort of processor to their mod or make an existing object a processor. Documentation can be found in the wiki on Github: https://github.com/Syrchalis/ProcessorFramework/wiki</p>

[h1]Get [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2244594116]RimTraits - Vanilla Trait Colors[/url] to change your Vanilla Trait Colors to match this mod![/h1]<br />
This Medieval trait mod adds 35 traits defining a pawn's talent, they are mutually exclusive to each other with increasing rarity for the higher tier traits.<br />
This mod operates on the premise that skills don't equate to talent, and talent doesn’t necessarily translate to passion.<br />
You could really love doing something but you could still suck at it. And likewise, you can have talent with something but you’re not necessarily passionate about them. These traits also give additional Temperature, Mood, Mental Break and Pain Tolerance buff to compensate for the lack of technology during medieval times, and to represent people's ability to face hardships during less civilized ages.<br />

<p>Adds a button to ask for quests in settlements.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3236876098">Simple HD Bodies</a> by RedMattis</h5>

<p>Simple body Textures. Aligns with the vanilla bodies, so virtually all apparel will look good with them.<br />
Intended as a bit simpler and more vanilla-looking alternative to "Beautiful Bodies".</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3237236490">Slightly Shiny Steel</a> by Chaingunfighter1 / Slippin' Jimmy,  b0nes</h5>

<p>Patches steel so that objects made of it are slightly brighter in game. Sightly darker than the Shiny Steel mod, placing it halfway between it and normal steel. The original mod was a little too white for me, so I decided to darken it a little, while still being lighter than vanilla.</p>

This DOES NOT Improve your loading time. It just shows you what takes up lots of time &amp; rescourses.<br />
NOTICE: This is NOT my mod. I simply took the files off GitHub from AUTOMATIC &amp; uploaded them to Steam (as theres only a 1.3 version on Steam right now)<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1938420742">Vanilla Events Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Kikohi,  Helixien,  Sarg</h5>

<p>Vanilla Events Expanded adds several new events to the game, all in line with vanilla events - nothing too drastic. A new tier of events is added - Purple events. Instead of having strict negative or positive effects, purple events force players to adapt as they last significantly longer than events like Toxic Fallout or Volcanic Winter.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1888705256">Vanilla Hair Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  XeoNovaDan</h5>

<p>We have all been there, with a colony of a hundred pawns where everyone looks somewhat the same. Starting colonists with no character to their looks. This mod is our attempt at fixing that.<br />
We have worked hard to create a hundred new hairstyles that fit vanilla RimWorld perfectly! From tribals to space refugees, every possible pawn receives a set of new, fitting styles that add much needed character and soul to them, and with so many new possibilities, it’s unlikely two of your pawns will look the same!<br />
And in case they do, one of our major features is a barber’s table - a workbench available to be built from the very start of the game, that allows you to change the hairstyle, colour and beard style of your pawns. Yes, you heard me right. We’re also adding 15 beards, which have a solid 20% chance to spawn on any male colonist! If, however, beards are not something you’re into, you can disable them in the mod settings!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2439736083">Vanilla Social Interactions Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Taranchuk</h5>

<p>Vanilla Social Interactions Expanded means to bring much more needed life to your pawns as well as the overall world map. This mod alters what pawns do in their spare time, adds some much needed content in regards to interactions that breathes fresh air into otherwise boring and stale game. Pawns now also have aspirations that can be fulfilled to gain powerful mood buffs, and the whole inspiration system is also changed.<br />
Each of the mechanics in this mod can be disabled in mod options.<br />
This mod adds following mechanics:<br />
- Memories<br />
- Inspiration Changes<br />
- Obtaining New traits<br />
- Venting<br />
- Friend and Best Friend<br />
- Teaching<br />
- Many hands make light work<br />
- Discord<br />
- New group activities<br />
- Dating<br />
- United We Stand<br />
- Hostile Environment<br />
- One Night Stand.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2296404655">Vanilla Traits Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Taranchuk,  Chowder</h5>

<p>Have you ever thought about how base game traits become repetitive after a while? Are you tired of seeing pyromaniac or kind pawn over and over again? Are you perhaps considering pyromaniac to be an instant death sentence in your colony? If for any of these questions the answer was ‘aye’, then look no further.<br />
Vanilla Traits Expanded adds 55 new traits, some offering unique new game mechanics, some being quirky and enhancing the storytelling, and some being straight up stat upgrades. Traits’ commonality has been adjusted after weeks of testing, to make sure no powerful or annoying traits appear too often.<br />
Using our new mod options menu, you can now disable specific traits added by vanilla game or any of the mods you have. This doesn’t mean that the trait will be magically removed from the pawn, but it’s commonality will be reduced to 0, stopping it from ever appearing in the game again.<br />
I really hope you will enjoy the effect of our hard work! Let us know in the comments what you think works and what doesn’t!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114453100">Vanilla Races Expanded - Lycanthrope</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Vanilla Races Expanded is a brand new series of mods to enhance Biotech features, add to the storytelling and the world-building of RimWorld, and to introduce new, cool types of xenohumans, complete with their own unique genes, behaviors, mechanics and items.<br />
Vanilla Races Expanded - Lycanthrope aims to bring a unique new archite-powered being into existence. Lycanthropes are seemingly simple baseliners with a unique ability to morph into a powerful lycan form. These lycans look similar to werewolves and excel in unarmed combat. Their rage and rapid regeneration allows them to sustain severe damage, while their claws and bites will shred even armored enemies to pieces.<br />
The functionality of the morph gene is extended further, allowing the Morph gene to appear in any genepacks, and morph into any of the existing xenotypes.</p>

<p>Vanilla Races Expanded is a brand new series of mods to enhance Biotech features, add to the storytelling and the world-building of RimWorld, and to introduce new, cool types ofxenohumans, complete with their own unique genes, behaviors, mechanics and items.<br />
This mod adds a new race called Phytokins, which are a unique and extremely rare xenotype that mixes the DNA of a plant with human DNA. Phytokins are capable of photosynthesis and reproduce via planting a saplingchild, and come in three varieties based on what DLCs you have enabled. With no other DLC, the only Phytokin variety present in the game will be the evil Poluxkin.<br />
Based on genetic data retrofitted from Gauranlen Inc.’s investment into dendrology following the Fall of Sorne, phytokins are plant-based humanoids with an emphasis on symmetry and symbiosis. Their ability to subsist only on sunlight and affinity with any and all plantlife make them especially suited to aiding newly established colonies or underperforming industrial farms.<br />
Based on research from the forest planet of Phytok that committed to extensive analysis on human-compatibility with psychic energy, phytokin xenogerms are typically exclusive to high-ranking, supporting roles in megacorporations and planetary governments. Their unique way of reproduction has resulted in many identical offspring, with each generation becoming successively more competent than their progenitor, further contributing to their extremely low numbers. Their affinity with plantlife, along with the side effect of extremely high and ever-increasing psychic sensitivity, mean that any phytokin xenohumans found on the Rim are always adapted to high-concept, dominant trees that are present on their residing planet.</p>

<p>Vanilla Races Expanded is a brand new series of mods to enhance Biotech features, add to the storytelling and the world-building of RimWorld, and to introduce new, cool types ofxenohumans, complete with their own unique genes, behaviors, mechanics and items.<br />
This mod adds a new race called Saurids, featuring xenohumans with lizard characteristics. A number of new genes will allow players to turn their pawns into cold-blooded scaly monstrosities, whilst a new Saurid faction will be added alongside the Outlander factions and will provide a steady supply of Saurids for the players that desire it.<br />
Genetically spliced with synthesized dinosaur genetic material for improved compatibility with arid environments, saurids are cold-blooded isolationists with harsh voices and extremely low metabolisms. Their sharp claws and hardened scales make them particularly suited to melee encounters.<br />
For workers looking for higher-wage jobs, saurid xenogerms are offered alongside employment packages to particularly arid and hot planets. As conditions are quite harsh, they experience an attitude shift to be less social and consume fewer calories which allows them to be more profitable. As they are not excluded from starting families, saurids can communicate with each other using pheromones and are oviparous to reduce medical complications caused by lack of proper social infrastructure.</p>
